# Riak Publish and Subscribe

## Overview

Work in progress, not for production use.

An attempt at modeling a fault-tolerant publish and subscribe system
with [riak\_core](http://github.com/basho/riak_core) and
[gproc](https://github.com/esl/gproc) as an alternative to using gproc's
global distribution model facilitated by gen\_leader.
